targets:
  # Name of the target to use by default if no target is specified in request header (mandatory)
  # Must match the name of one of the targets defined below
  default: openai

  # List of targets
  # * url is mandatory and is the base url of the target
  #
  # * if an api key is needed to acces the target you should provide either a key or and envkey:
  #   - if a key is provided, the value of the key will be used as the api key
  #   - if an envkey is provided, the value of the "envkey" environment variable will be used as the api key
  #   - if both are provided, the key value will be used as the api key, and the envkey will be ignored
  # !   In production, only use envkey!!!
  #
  # * preserveMethod: during http permanent redirections (301), POST method is normally converted to GET, which may be a problem
  # *                 if the target endpoint only supports POST. If preserveMethod is set to true,
  # *                 the original method is preserved (optional, default to false)
  #
  # * mapping is mandatory and defines the supported incoming endpoints:
  #   - Each mapping entry defines how to map an incoming endpoint path
  #   - endpoints not defined here will be rejected with a 404 HTTP error
  #   - Each mapping entry can be:
  #     - empty: the incoming endpoint path will be used as the target endpoint path, with no transcoding (pass through)
  #     - a string: the incoming endpoint path will be mapped to the target endpoint path, with no transcoding
  #     - an object, with the following properties:
  #       - path: the target endpoint path to use (optional, default to the incoming endpoint path)
  #       - in: the transcoding to apply to the incoming request body (optional, default to identity)
  #       - out: the transcoding to apply to the target response body (optional, default to identity)
  #       - prompter: the prompter.function to use to transform a list of messages into a string (optional, default to no prompter)
  #       - template: the prompt template to use (optional, default to no template, disregarded if prompter does not use templates)
  #
  # TODO: Add HTTP Method filtering because now POST, GET and INFO are (hopefully gracefully) handled in the same way
